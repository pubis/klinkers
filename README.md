#Klinkers

Klinkers is a personal finance application written in Ruby on Rails.

##WIP

Currently Klinkers support some basic accounting where you can create accounts and transfer money and make payments/deposits to them. It supports split transactions but the UI for that isn't realy implemented yet.
There is also budgets where you assign amounts to categories and basically watch that gets eaten up by the transactions you make.

##Demo

A demo should be available at [klinkers.pubis.se][demo]. Just create a fake user and play around if you like. (Set the email to delete_me@example.com or something like that if you wan't me to remove the user after your done)

##I18n

Written in bad Enlish and translated to Swedish, _är det inte underbart så säg!_

##Legal stuff

I should probably release this under some sort of open source license, but I need to read up on that...

So for the time being, if you find something useful, have at it!
